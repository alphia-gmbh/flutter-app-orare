# Readme Orare

**Orare** is a minimal, intuitive gratitude journaling app crafted by [Alphia](https://www.alphia.io). It helps you focus on what truly matters by making it easy to capture meaningful moments each day.

We’re sharing this app as part of our commitment to transparency, mindful design, and open development. While not built for wide collaboration, we hope it brings value to those who care deeply about intentional, thoughtful user experiences.

## Main Features
- Capture thoughts and moments in seconds with a clean, distraction-free interface designed for speed and simplicity
- Built-in prompts and customizable reminders help you build a consistent habit of reflection and gratitude
- Your journal entries are safely synced and backed, so your memories are always protected and available across devices
- And many more
